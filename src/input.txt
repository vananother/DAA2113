The concept of stability of a computational algorithm is analogous to conditioning of a
mathematical problem. Both concepts have to do with sensitivity to perturbations, but
the term stability is usually used for algorithms and conditioning for problems (although
stability is sometimes used for problems as well, especially in differential equations). An
algorithm is stable if the result it produces is relatively insensitive to perturbations resulting
from approximations made during the computation. From the viewpoint of backward error
analysis, an algorithm is stable if the result it produces is the exact solution to a nearby
problem.
